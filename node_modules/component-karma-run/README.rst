component-karma-run - Run karma tests on ComponentJS projects
=============================================================

Runs the karma test runner with ``--single-run``. If there is no
``karma.conf.js`` found in the current working directory then one is created.
The generated ``karma.conf.js`` is ephemeral. This allows for quick testing on
small projects.

Usage
-----

Simple example (tests code in Chrome and Firefox)::
    
    $ component karma-run

Specify browsers (test in Chrome, Firefox, and PhantomJS)::
    
    $ component karma-run --browsers Chrome,Firefox,PhantomJS
