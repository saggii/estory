  "readme": "karma-jstd-adapter\n==================\n\nThis is an adapter for the [Karma Test Runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/) for [Js-Test-Driver](https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/).\n\nBasically that means that if you use this, you should be able to use Karma instead of Js-Test-Driver,\nwith out making any changes to your tests. It's possible I broke some things though.\n\n[Another adapter exists](https://github.com/vojtajina/karma-jstd), but it takes a much different\napproach than this adapter does, by adding a layer on top of [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/)\nto simulate the features of Js-Test-Driver. Because of this, it is not yet feature-complete (for example,\nwhile I was still using it, I had to write my own queue for AsyncTestCase.)\n\nThis adapter instead does a wholesale import of the JavaScript portions of Js-Test-Driver, and uses\nthat to provide the hooks into Karma. This provides the advantage of having most/all of Js-Test-Driver's\nfunctionality, without the cost of having to write a layer on top of Jasmine or anything else. On the other hand,\nJs-Test-Driver is a complex beast, and I'm certain there's a lot of code we're pulling over from Js-Test-Driver\nthat is never going to be run, but I don't have the time to figure out what parts we need, and what parts\nwe don't.\n\nWhat Works\n----------\n\nAs far as I can tell, everything works. The only thing that probably doesn't work is Js-Test-Driver's\n[HtmlDoc feature](https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/HtmlDoc), I believe that was implemented in\nJava, and thus wasn't pulled over into this adapter. I don't use that feature, so I can't confirm\nwhether it works or not. Hopefully it wouldn't be too implement that functionality if anyone needs it.\n\nInstalling\n----------\n\nBasically all you need is `jstd-adapter.js`, so you can either download it from GitHub, or\nyou can use `npm install karma-jstd-adapter`. In either case, add `jstd-adapter.js` to the list\nof files Karma will load, and you'll be set to go.\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\n\"Building?\" you ask, \"What do you mean building?\"\n\nIf you were looking at the files in this project, you may have noticed `inserter.js` and `jstd-adapter-template.js`.\n`jstd-adapter-template.js` contains the code that interfaces with Karma, but needs the Js-Test-Driver\ncode to operate. `inserter.js` reads in the Js-Test-Driver code, does a few manipulations, and then\ninserts it into the text of `jstd-adapter-template.js` and produces `jstd-adapter.js`.\n\nIf you wanted to produce the `jstd-adapter.js` file yourself for whatever reason (say a new version\nof Js-Test-Driver comes out.), you'll need to do two things:\n\n1. [Download the Js-Test-Driver jar file](https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/downloads/list).\n2. Unzip it somewhere.\n3. Run `node inserter.js C:\\path\\to\\Js-Test-Driver\\com\\google\\jstestdriver\\javascript\\`\n\nAnd you'll be good to go!\n\nFound a bug?
