karma-jstd-adapter
==================

This is an adapter for the [Karma Test Runner](http://karma-runner.github.io/) for [Js-Test-Driver](https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/).

Basically that means that if you use this, you should be able to use Karma instead of Js-Test-Driver,
with out making any changes to your tests. It's possible I broke some things though.

[Another adapter exists](https://github.com/vojtajina/karma-jstd), but it takes a much different
approach than this adapter does, by adding a layer on top of [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/)
to simulate the features of Js-Test-Driver. Because of this, it is not yet feature-complete (for example,
while I was still using it, I had to write my own queue for AsyncTestCase.)

This adapter instead does a wholesale import of the JavaScript portions of Js-Test-Driver, and uses
that to provide the hooks into Karma. This provides the advantage of having most/all of Js-Test-Driver's
functionality, without the cost of having to write a layer on top of Jasmine or anything else. On the other hand,
Js-Test-Driver is a complex beast, and I'm certain there's a lot of code we're pulling over from Js-Test-Driver
that is never going to be run, but I don't have the time to figure out what parts we need, and what parts
we don't.

What Works
----------

As far as I can tell, everything works. The only thing that probably doesn't work is Js-Test-Driver's
[HtmlDoc feature](https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/wiki/HtmlDoc), I believe that was implemented in
Java, and thus wasn't pulled over into this adapter. I don't use that feature, so I can't confirm
whether it works or not. Hopefully it wouldn't be too implement that functionality if anyone needs it.

Installing
----------

Basically all you need is `jstd-adapter.js`, so you can either download it from GitHub, or
you can use `npm install karma-jstd-adapter`. In either case, add `jstd-adapter.js` to the list
of files Karma will load, and you'll be set to go.

Building
--------

"Building?" you ask, "What do you mean building?"

If you were looking at the files in this project, you may have noticed `inserter.js` and `jstd-adapter-template.js`.
`jstd-adapter-template.js` contains the code that interfaces with Karma, but needs the Js-Test-Driver
code to operate. `inserter.js` reads in the Js-Test-Driver code, does a few manipulations, and then
inserts it into the text of `jstd-adapter-template.js` and produces `jstd-adapter.js`.

If you wanted to produce the `jstd-adapter.js` file yourself for whatever reason (say a new version
of Js-Test-Driver comes out.), you'll need to do two things:

1. [Download the Js-Test-Driver jar file](https://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/downloads/list).
2. Unzip it somewhere.
3. Run `node inserter.js C:\path\to\Js-Test-Driver\com\google\jstestdriver\javascript\`

And you'll be good to go!
